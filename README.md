# GDev-Profile-Badge-Scraper
###GDev Profile Badge Scraper is a Google Developer Profile Web Scraper which scrapes for specific badges in a user's Google Developer Profile. This first version is specific to the use case for detecting 16 badges for Android Study Jam participants/facilitators and gives an output of each badge filtered individually. As Google themselves do not provide a service to track multiple user's GDev profile, I thought of writing this script myself. This script has a time complexity of 8(n). It can further be modified to reduce the time complexity.
